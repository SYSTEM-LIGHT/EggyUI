## ✨ EggyUI Development History and End

*   **Origin and Early Versions (2024)**:
    *   The project began in April 2024, initially designing a Shell interface for a Windows PE maintenance system named EggyOS.
    *   **July 22, 2024**: EggyUI 1.0 released, supporting only Windows 11.
    *   **August 8, 2024**: EggyUI 2.0 released as a standalone installer, but was heavily criticized for its complex installation process.

*   **The 2.5 Experiment and Its Issues (2025)**:
    *   **January 25, 2025**: EggyUI 2.5 system image released. This version used a pre-deployed Windows 11 24H2 environment for packaging and introduced acrylic effects. It included deeply customized installation interfaces, *Eggy Party* mouse pointers, and more. However, this version also exposed significant compatibility issues with the system image and stability risks associated with underlying components written in the Chinese programming language E.

*   **The 3.0 Setback and Team Rifts (2025)**:
    *   **Mid-March 2025**: The project's core communication group was unexpectedly disbanded, **resulting in the loss of critical 3.0 installation packages and resource files**, halting development. The project was later salvaged by a community member using local backups.
    *   **May 2025**: Core developer **Sylphy** left the team. Serious disagreements arose within the team regarding the project's future, leading to a "temporary dissolution" announcement. Although opposed by the founder and others, team morale and cohesion suffered irreversible damage.
    *   **Unrealized Vision**: The planned AI-powered desktop pet ("Eggy Desktop Pet"), developed in Python for version 3.0, was ultimately abandoned due to technical complexity, failure of dependent services, and the departure of core developers.

*   **The Final Version: Innovations in 3.5 (2025)**:
    *   Driven by the remaining developers, the project underwent a final technological overhaul.
    *   Core components were **rewritten using the .NET framework** to address performance, security, and maintainability issues present in the E-language components.
    *   A **Windows system image with unattended automated deployment** was adopted as the installation method.
    *   **July 22, 2025** (on the project's first anniversary), the EggyUI 3.5 system image was released as the **final version** of the project.

*   **The End of the Project**:
    *   **Final State**: EggyUI 3.5 is the **final official version** of this project. The team will **no longer produce** any new system images or versions adapted for other systems (such as Windows 10). Furthermore, the previously planned **standalone installer has been confirmed as canceled**.
    *   **Team Dissolution**: Project founder BSOD-MEMZ and other core developers have all departed. As of October 2025, the project team has effectively dissolved and no longer conducts any form of development, maintenance, or recruitment. So-called "EggyUI 4.0" or any form of "revival" does not exist in any planned form.

## ⚠️ Reflection: Why It Ended Here

The demise of EggyUI was ultimately not due to technical limitations, but stemmed from long-accumulated and unresolved governance crises within the team.

*   **Technical Debt**: The extensive early use of the Chinese programming language E led to inherent flaws in components, sowing the seeds for future compatibility and performance issues. Although a shift to .NET occurred later, the cost of refactoring was prohibitively high.
*   **Fragile Management**: The project lacked effective decision-making mechanisms and a stable management structure. Critical permissions were centralized without checks and balances, leading to inadequate crisis response (e.g., file loss during group dissolution).
*   **Communication Barriers**: Poor communication among core members and opaque decision-making processes led to frequent changes in direction, draining development enthusiasm.
*   **Contributor Attrition**: The successive departure of core developers directly hollowed out the project's technical continuity and innovation capacity.

The creation and maintenance of this repository aim to preserve a complete technical archive and historical lesson for this once passionate project. It documents an exploration into Windows desktop customization and serves as a witness to the common challenges loosely organized teams can face without effective governance.

**To all users who ever supported, used, or even sponsored EggyUI, we extend our sincerest gratitude. The story has ended, but the code and its lessons remain.**
